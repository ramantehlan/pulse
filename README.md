# Development

- ReactJS
- Golang
- Socket.io
- NextJS
- Snap Packaging

## Commands

`make dev` to setup dev environment
`make build` to build the project


## To test with the front end

- In root, run `make start`, this will start the server.
- Make changes to client and run npm dev server `npm dev`, it will run on 7001, but will communicate with 7000.

> You might have to allow cross origin in your browser to test it, it will work fine in production as the server and template both will be on 7000 port
